The EUDigiParty data set supports researchers interested in investigating digital communication activities by political parties in Europe by providing an extensive list of partiesâ€™ social media accounts on major digital platforms as of June 2024. The data is valuable for researchers in the fields of political communication, political science, political sociology, and computational social science to inspect party dynamics in Europe from a comparative perspective. The data set also includes identifiers from the Partyfacts database [Version 2023] to enable linking the EUDigiParty data with existing data sets on political parties or country-level data in the European Union.
